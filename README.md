# Partial Ring
## Take points distributed evenly around a circle and eliminate points which don't enable one to draw a line with a unique slope.

I saw a woman at lunch who was wearing shoes with round faux buckles on them.
My thought was that it would be possible to fit embedded controllers in the buckles - but to what purpose?
One purpose I could think of would be a compass that one could wear on hiking boots or trail shoes.
Then I thought, instead of indicating direction with one LED in a ring of LED's with another implied at the center of the ring,
one could indicate direction with two LED's in that ring, defining the line that passes through both of the LED's.
Then I noticed that a regular circle with evenly spaced LED's would have a lot of redundancy if you just needed two lights to indicate a direction.
I worked out the specifics first for 4 LED's repositioned and they looked like 4 corners of a hexagon.
Then I figured it out for a few others and found a method.
Then of course that seemed like a good little programming project... and here it is.

So future plans are to draw color coded lines between the points.
